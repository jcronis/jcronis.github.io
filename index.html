    <p>Hi. I'm Jason Ronis.</p>
    <p>I am currently a student at Tech Elevator, where I am learning to be a full stack software developer. </p>
    <p>I drink a lot of black coffee. I mean cup after cup. It is my favorite zero calorie treat.</p>
    <p>This site will have information about me and my hacked together junky code (which is improving rapidly).</p>
    <p>Here's a picture of me.</p>
    <img src="croppedHS.jpg" style="width:460px;height:310px;">
    <p>This page is about my growing skillset, and the kinds of jobs I think I am interested in and increasingly becoming qualified for.</p>
    <!-- put another image here-->
    <p>I am now skilled with Java and SQL, and I am quickly gaining skills with html, CSS, and javascript.</p>
    <p>Here is my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonronis/">LinkedIn</a>. page. Some of skills listed I have and others I will gain over the next six weeks)</p>
    <p>I lack certain concerns about design asthetic and presentation that would lead me to make a good page here, 
        but I have other skills. For example I am the owner of multiple homes approaching 100 years old, and have become an experienced
        amature just about anything needed to maintain and repair these houses. Between myself and friends who I help most weekends
        we have all the tools, and a seemingly unlimited amount of work to do. I've been thinking of starting an obscene website about the 
        real difficulties in maintaining old home. We were kicking around the title ThisFuckingOldHouse and would write up photo heavy 
        recaps of each weekend's experiences, which are often painfully comic tales about knowing what you're doing and having some level of 
        failure practically assured based on the frailty of the substrate.</p>
    <p> Almost certainly more interesting to a prospective employer is that for the past decade I have been studying markets while running 
        an investment club that has beaten a 10% return yearly for a decade now. It involves an incredible amount of research on my part.
        Right now (this month) for example I'm looking at different kinds of bond funds to store some cash. We are currently 'Equity Heavy' and 
        atypically high risk (higher exected beta over the next year) than I would like. The trick to staying on track to get strong returns 
        from this kind of portfolio even in worse years is not ignoring decisions that could be boring. So for instance we could buy 10 year 
        US treasury bonds, and receive a whopping 2.2% return, but those dollars eventhough perfectly safe would be providing a drag on our total 
        portfolio's return that could be hard to make up. This month in addition to the US treasury option, I'm going to present (with humor) 
        options ranging from Puerto Rican debt which is currently in a distressed state, but is also trading at a 72% discount to face value 
        It's quite rare for a part of the US to default in a way where lenders walk away with less than 50% of face value on debt, and given the
        relativly small size of the total debt (and wallstreet connectedness of the administration) I wouldn't be shocked if debtholders 
        take a smaller than usual loss, making these bonds a steal. There are less interesting, and more probable investments from 
        bond funds like DHY, DSM, and, IHY, but the really interesting (and improbable) option is Pyongyang Municipal Bonds. I know what you're
        saying, that's a terrible idea. And from an investment standpoint you're probably right. I mean you take an international bond, which
        will have extra accounting issues, and many banks wont deal with you if you hold them, and you lump that on top of the normal currency risk, 
        the normal (or abnormal but priced in) default risk, and then you get the special 'carpetbombing risk' that you really don't have to 
        consider elsewhere in the world. And what do you get for that? an 18% yield as long as there are people there to pay. And their money is worth anything,
        and, your bank will accept their payment, and they have the money to pay you at all... It's a bad investment, but a good idea from
        a thought experiment perspective if nothing else.</p>
