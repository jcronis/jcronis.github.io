    <p>Hi. I'm Jason Ronis.</p>
    <p>I am currently a student at Tech Elevator, where I am learning to be a full stack software developer. </p>
    <p>I drink a lot of black coffee. I mean cup after cup. It is my favorite zero calorie treat.</p>
    <p>This site will have information about me and my hacked together junky code (which is improving rapidly).</p>
    <p>Here's a picture of me.</p>
    <img src="croppedHS.jpg" style="width:460px;height:310px;">
    <p> This page is about my growing skillset, and the kinds of jobs I think I am interested in and increasingly becoming qualified for.</p>
